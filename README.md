News project assigned by Technigo. I wrote it for introverted people. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

the project had to be responsive, and have different layouts depending on the screen. Something I'm still figuring out.
