      <p>Have you ever gone to a really fun party, but then had the urge to go and hide? This just means that you need to reload to find new energy like all introverts.
        The best thing you can to is take micro-pauses, you either go to the kitchen, the garden, or maybe hide out in the bathroom for a while (for an ok amount of time, 
        we don't want people thinking that you're weird, do we. And it's also kind of mean to make camp in the bathroom at a party with a lot of people and only one bathroom!).
        An other way to save up some energy is to go to this party with an extroverted friend, this friend will take up most of the attention and you'll be able to fly under the radar,
        until you're ready to mingle again! Have fun, get to know people, and remember, you're not alone, a lot of people feel the same way. Maybe you can find a group of introverts and 
        you can just sit there for a while in quiet. </p>
